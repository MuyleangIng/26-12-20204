        <p>Angkor Wat was commissioned by the Khmer king Suryavarman II (ruled 1113–c. 1150) in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire. The construction of the temple commenced in 1122 CE and was completed in 1150 CE.[6] The temple complex was constructed on the suggestion of Divākarapaṇḍita (1040–c. 1120).[7] The temple was dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu and the original religious motifs were derived from Hinduism.[8] It was built as the king's state temple in the capital city. While there are no foundation stela or any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple's name that have been found, its original name is unknown and it may have been known as Vrah Viṣṇuloka after the presiding deity.[4] The work on the temple ceased after the king's death, leaving some of the bas-relief decoration unfinished.[9]</p>
